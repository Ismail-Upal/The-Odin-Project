        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Biryani is a flavorful South Asian dish made with aromatic basmati rice, marinated meat, and a blend of spices. <br>
            It's often layered and cooked slowly to allow all the rich flavors to come together. Popular variants include chicken, beef, mutton, and vegetable biryani.
